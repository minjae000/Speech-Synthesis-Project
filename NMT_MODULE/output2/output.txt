Hi, I am Professor Park Tae-joon.
This time, let's make sure you understand the linear regression algorithm mathematically.
As discussed above, the linear regression model is good.
And this line can be expressed as a straight line equation.
For example, y can be expressed in this way that b is added to ax.
Here, A is the slope, and B is the y intercept.
I'm going to take the테이션 from now on.
The y section is expressed as theta zero. The slope is expressed as theta one.
These two parameters determine a straight equation.
The straight line is expressed by adding hx to theta-zero and then theta one-x.
So theta zero is the slope of the y-section, and theta one is the slope.
hx is the predicted value.
But to emphasize that the parameter of this straight line is theta one.
Under h, theta was written as a subscript.
The parameter of this straight line is called theta.
It's a measure that tells you if it's not good.
If you look at the screen, as shown in the figure, we are closest to a given dataset.
The straight line of the yaw is marked with red.
Let's take a look at how it is used to create a linear regression model and make predictions.
I know what you are thinking.
There is a linear regression algorithm in the middle of the screen.
This linear regression algorithm receives the dataset created in the remember phase as an input.
It is an algorithm that creates the linear regression model h theta x.
How this algorithm works is as discussed in the previous lecture.
The slope and y-section values are arbitrarily initialized.
Let's take an example.
Was it all about the algorithm that repeatedly repeated the process of moving?
So if you continue to execute this simple algorithm repeatedly and repeatedly, it will be.
h theta x made in this way.
The number of rooms or the size of the house.
By receiving the characteristics as an input, the characteristics are received as an input.
It tracks predicted values such as house prices.
What's the output?
The predicted value is the predicted value of the housing price.
Through the linear regression algorithm, it is possible to perform a linear regression.
A model or straight equation h theta x is created.
This is the stage of predicting.
In this figure, the process of creating a dataset at the center is the same.
Creating hx in the linear regression algorithm is the formulate step.
You can check that you are alive.
In this linear regression algorithm, the linear regression is performed.
A model that minimizes the difference between the correct answer value or the label and the predicted value.
The method is presented on the screen.
There is a data set on the left side of the screen.
The input feature is the size of the house.
There are several datasets.
The second data is x2 y2.
What's x3 y4 x4 like this?
The dataset is that the values are presented in a graph.
Then this dataset can be visualized on a two-dimensional plane like the right one.
How is visualization? The horizontal axis is the size of the house, how is the visualization?
The longitudinal axis is the price of a house.
In addition, you can take a point one by one while having all the data.
The advantages are indicated by orange x.
What are we going to do?
It is specific data, for example, the ith data, and then the ith data.
The correct answer to the label or the yi and yi to the label corresponding to the label.
Then, in the direction of reducing the difference between the predicted values.
Then, how do you find the predicted value?
In addition to x of model h theta x.
It is only necessary to substitute the i-th data xi.
Then the predicted value comes out.
Let's take a look at an example.
Here, the fourth data, x4 and x4 are shown on the screen.
I'll look at y4.
What is the correct answer value?
As shown on the screen, y4.
What is the predicted value of the담?
Then, the difference between y4 and hx4 is calculated.
How did you say that the values of theta zero and theta one are changed?
There is a need data point corresponding to x4.
Is it above or below the straight line?
Then, decide whether it is the right or left of the y-axis.
It is to repeat the process of rotating and moving.
In this case, it is above the line and above the line.
Then, what's wrong on the y-axis?
The slope increases by increasing.
It rotates and increases in a counterclockwise direction.
It was moved upward.
Then, what happens in the process?
Theta one value, which corresponds to the slope, also changes.
Theta zero value, which corresponds to the y section, is also changed.
It is only a mathematically expressed one.
please learn how the linear regression algorithms learned in the lecture are expressed mathematically.
I expressed the linear regression algorithm we learned a bit mathematically.
Next, to supplement the algorithm, the algorithm is supplemented.
There are necessary means for us.
There is a need for a means to measure how good a model or straight line is.
This means we call the cost function, the cost function.
So I'll let you learn about this.
This method can be said to be a cost function.
Conversely, the cost function denotes how the model works.
There are two models or straight lines on the left and right.
The dataset is the same. The four data points are the same on the left and right.
The straight lines are different from each other.
안보ing at it, the left is a bad model, and the right is a good model.
Why is the left a bad model and the right a good model?
The left is a given data point, and it means that it is not the closest straight line.
The right is a better model or straight line compared to the left.
Otherwise, this cost function is self-evident.
On the left, a large value is allocated for bad models.
A small value is assigned to a good model on the right.
So, one straight line came out.
Let's see how a cost function suitable for a linear regression model can be defined.
There are two types. There are two methods: absolute error, and square error.
There are several lengths that can define a cost function or a cost function, but there are several lengths.
These are the two that we will look at.
absolute error, absolute error in English, is called absolute error.
It is the sum of the vertical distances from one point of the dataset to the straight line.
The square error is the sum of the squares of these vertical distances.
There are two factors. You can define cost functions or cost functions with these two factors.
Then, first, we will define the cost function as the absolute error.
The absolute error absolute error is the difference between each point of the dataset and the absolute error.
It is the sum of the vertical distances between straight lines.
We looked at it in a mathematical model, but what is the need to calculate this vertical distance?
The difference between the label or the correct answer value and the predicted value is used.
That's why, for example, in the fourth day?
What do you do when you go up and down vertically?
It is the predicted value when it passes through a straight line.
Then go up and down a little bit.
It's vertical.
Then, what will this difference be?
Whether the point is above or below the line can be positive or negative.
So, in order to always change this difference to a positive number, the absolute value is taken.
It means that if you add up a difference for all data, it becomes a cost function.
Then, a good linear regression model is a model close to a line.
Perhaps it will be the latter.
How do you do to do that? You have to make it a line that minimizes the sum of errors.
It is to select a line where the sum of the vertical distances from each point to the line becomes the minimum.
On average, it is the line where the sum of the vertical distances becomes the minimum.
In that respect, it means that the cost function can be defined.
There are two models discussed earlier, and there are good models on the left and bad models on the right.
I will add an error.
There is a vertical distance from each of the four points to the line, and if you add up, there is a very long error.
Isn't it right? Isn't the vertical distance from each point to the straight line is small? If you add it, there will be a very small error.
The left is large and the right is small.
It can be seen that the right is a relatively more suitable model than the left.
Then, how do we make use of it?
What happens when data is given, and there is only one straight line?
So, you have to see if you respond or not?
Such a method that goes down from the mountain phase and how it goes down are discussed.
somewhere in the mountains.
At what level is it?
If the position of a mountain is straight, then the altitude at that position is changed to a cost value.
Looking at this, does the cost function look like a valley rather than an acid one?
An algorithm that slowly descends from the mountains, or an algorithm that descends the lowest point in a valley.
It is said to be a straight line or a model.
The담 is equivalent to the height at that point.
It will be possible to find the best model.
Think about the algorithm that comes down from the mountains.
This means that through each stage, one model is changed to a slightly better model.
It is one step lower than the current model, so it is a step forward.
It is in the direction of lowering than the current ones.
So, through each step, we go through each step.
It's a slightly better model.
If you continue to look at this, you can find the best model.
Finally, the best model in the end.
It will be possible to find the minimum model.
So, in this way, keep in mind the method used when slowly coming down from the mountains of Inje.
Let's take a closer look at how it operated.
First, the initial values of the slope and the wire section are arbitrarily selected.
It is a random selection.
Then the value of the cost function decreases in the direction.
The slope and the value of the wire section are continuously changed.
Continuing to change will be the key.
How to design the process will be the core. What should I do?
To help us understand, we too.
It's a little difficult to visualize and imagine, so it's easy to simplify the problem.
There is no other reason.
As discussed above, as discussed earlier.
As you have seen here, it has a quadratic function.
And the formula used to change the value.
But what's the point of subtracting the price?
The second step is to continuously repeat the urinary process.
This part can be explained by complex mathematics and differential coefficients, but it can be explained by complex mathematics and differential coefficients.
Then, let's take an actual example.
Let's take a look.
Let's find out. First, the first step is.
The initial value of the Seta is randomly selected to 5 degrees.
Of course, every time an algorithm is executed, this initial value changes.
So, some times it can be negative 3, some times it can be positive 1, and then it's different.
However, when the algorithm is executed, the initial value changes. But does the final result also change?
It wasn't that that, but it was always the same as the final result.
If you run the algorithm, you will know why it is the same.
What are you going to do after picking the initial value of the person?
It is a repetitive process, how did you say that it was repeated?
If it is the right of the target point, the slope value is the slope value.
The sign becomes a positive number.
It's like subtracting a price, so it's updated in the direction of getting smaller.
For example, there may be a secondary value on the left side of the target point because the initial value is randomly selected.
For example, the initial value was not wrong, and it was negative.
If you run the algorithm, there may be an initial value of Seta because it is negative sometimes.
Then, what's wrong? In conclusion, the Seta is updated in the direction of growing.
Let's take a look at why.
I think the sound will come out.
If the negative value is subtracted, the negative value is subtracted.
It's like adding a positive value, so what's wrong?
In both of these cases, this is the case for both.
In the direction of reducing and lowering, in the direction of reducing.
From the ceremony, looking at the middle of the ceremony.
It will be a value that sets how much the format will be updated.
It will not change much from the right.
However, it was close to the goal, so it was.
You'll get the minimum.
The interval to find the minimum is the interval.
If the learning rate is small, it will become small.
So, you have to update Seta several times, but you have to update it.
It can be seen that the minimum can be clearly reached.
If the learning rate is low, the computer suffers more. However, if it is small, the computer suffers more.
I hope you understand that the minimum can be clearly reached.
On the contrary, if the learning rate is high, what will happen?
The gap between finding the minimum increases.
What if it grows bigger?
It is on the left side of the target value.
If you find the minimum price, the number of updates can be reduced.
If you go along to zigzag, it's not every day, and it's like a thousand times.
It can be done a few and a dozen times.
The number of updates can be reduced.
This is a good case.
If it is good, the number of updates can be reduced. We can also find the minimum value.
After all, you can't find the minimum price and run out.
What's wrong in this case? You can't find the absolute minimum and go to the wrong place.
There may be such a case.
If the learning rate increases, the learning rate increases.
It cannot be tested, the minimum value cannot be found, and it can also radiate.
So, it is good to set an appropriate value for the learning rate.
A safely small value is better than a large one.
If the learning rate is small, it converges unconditionally.
How to select the learning rate parameters well for the data is important.
I have changed it in a variety of ways, and now I am experimenting to find the right learning rate for the data.
You should find the learning rate.
I will finish the lecture this week.
Hi, I am Professor Park Tae-joon.
This time, let's make sure you understand the linear regression algorithm mathematically.
As discussed above, the linear regression model is good.
And this line can be expressed as a straight line equation.
For example, y can be expressed in this way that b is added to ax.
Here, A is the slope, and B is the y intercept.
I'm going to take the테이션 from now on.
The y section is expressed as theta zero. The slope is expressed as theta one.
These two parameters determine a straight equation.
The straight line is expressed by adding hx to theta-zero and then theta one-x.
So theta zero is the slope of the y-section, and theta one is the slope.
hx is the predicted value.
But to emphasize that the parameter of this straight line is theta one.
Under h, theta was written as a subscript.
The parameter of this straight line is called theta.
It's a measure that tells you if it's not good.

The correct answer to the label or the yi and yi to the label corresponding to the label.
Then, in the direction of reducing the difference between the predicted values.

In addition to x of model h theta x.
It is only necessary to substitute the i-th data xi.

I'll look at y4.
What is the correct answer value?
As shown on the screen, y4.
What is the predicted value of the담?
Then, the difference between y4 and hx4 is calculated.
How did you say that the values of theta zero and theta one are changed?
There is a need data point corresponding to x4.
Is it above or below the straight line?
Then, decide whether it is the right or left of the y-axis.
It is to repeat the process of rotating and moving.
In this case, it is above the line and above the line.
Then, what's wrong on the y-axis?
The slope increases by increasing.
It rotates and increases in a counterclockwise direction.
It was moved upward.
Then, what happens in the process?
Theta one value, which corresponds to the slope, also changes.
Theta zero value, which corresponds to the y section, is also changed.
It is only a mathematically expressed one.

Why is the left a bad model and the right a good model?
The left is a given data point, and it means that it is not the closest straight line.
The right is a better model or straight line compared to the left.
Otherwise, this cost function is self-evident.
On the left, a large value is allocated for bad models.
A small value is assigned to a good model on the right.
So, one straight line came out.
Let's see how a cost function suitable for a linear regression model can be defined.
There are two types. There are two methods: absolute error, and square error.

The absolute error absolute error is the difference between each point of the dataset and the absolute error.
It is the sum of the vertical distances between straight lines.
We looked at it in a mathematical model, but what is the need to calculate this vertical distance?
The difference between the label or the correct answer value and the predicted value is used.
That's why, for example, in the fourth day?
What do you do when you go up and down vertically?
It is the predicted value when it passes through a straight line.
Then go up and down a little bit.
It's vertical.
Then, what will this difference be?
Whether the point is above or below the line can be positive or negative.
So, in order to always change this difference to a positive number, the absolute value is taken.
It means that if you add up a difference for all data, it becomes a cost function.
Then, a good linear regression model is a model close to a line.
Perhaps it will be the latter.
How do you do to do that? You have to make it a line that minimizes the sum of errors.
It is to select a line where the sum of the vertical distances from each point to the line becomes the minimum.
On average, it is the line where the sum of the vertical distances becomes the minimum.

There are two models discussed earlier, and there are good models on the left and bad models on the right.
I will add an error.
There is a vertical distance from each of the four points to the line, and if you add up, there is a very long error.
Isn't it right? Isn't the vertical distance from each point to the straight line is small? If you add it, there will be a very small error.
The left is large and the right is small.
It can be seen that the right is a relatively more suitable model than the left.
Then, how do we make use of it?
What happens when data is given, and there is only one straight line?
So, you have to see if you respond or not?
Such a method that goes down from the mountain phase and how it goes down are discussed.

This is a good case.
